# 🩺 Diabetes/Hypertension Tracker App

## 📘 Project Overview

This is a mobile health-tracking application aimed at helping patients with **diabetes** and/or **hypertension** log their health data, visualize trends, and receive smart lifestyle recommendations.

The app consists of:
- A **Flutter frontend** (modern, user-friendly UI)
- A **Django backend** (secure APIs and user management)
- AI/ML-based **predictive modeling** for personalized suggestions
